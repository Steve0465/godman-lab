---

## 🎯 YOUR ACTUAL TO-DO LIST

### **Priority 1: Invoice the 17 Unbilled Jobs** ⚠️

These are **confirmed unbilled** - do these first!

1. Nolen Canon - Tunica, MS - Install Cover
2. The Landings Apartments - Memphis
3. Susan Krigbaum - Cordova - Install Cover

**Estimated Value:** $3,000 - $8,000
**Timeline:** Invoice this week!

---

### **Priority 2: Verify the 83 Completed Jobs** 🔍

**Key Question:** Were you paid for these?

These jobs are marked "Complete" but:
- Not in your BILLS list (paid)
- Not in "Need to Bill" list (unbilled)

**What this probably means:**
- ✅ You were paid (cash, check, credit card)
- ❌ You just forgot to move the card to BILLS

**What you need to do:**
1. Go through these 83 jobs
2. Check your memory/bank records
3. For each one:
   - **If PAID:** Move card to BILLS list, add note: "Paid [date] - [method]"
   - **If UNPAID:** Move to "Jobs that need to bill for"

Recent Examples to Check:
- Yan Cao - Memphis - Install Spa Cover (Nov 27)
- Willie Phillips - Oxford, MS (Nov 8)
- Walter McGaha - Memphis - WARRANTY (Oct 1)
- Vanessa Gibson - Collierville (Oct 28)
- Tracy Walsh - Collierville (Oct 17)

**This is mainly a record-keeping task, not a billing crisis!**

## 💡 **THE REAL ISSUE: Workflow Gap**

### Current Problem:
When you complete a job, you move it to "Complete" but don't track:
- ✅ Was I paid?
- ✅ How much?
- ✅ When?
- ✅ How (cash/check/card)?

### The Fix: **Use Your BILLS List!**

**New Workflow:**
```
Job Done → Get Paid → Move to BILLS → Add Payment Details
```

**On the card, add:**
- Amount: $350
- Date: Dec 12, 2024
- Method: Cash / Check / Credit Card / Venmo
- Move to BILLS list

**Benefits:**
- Easy to see what's been paid
- Easy to generate revenue reports
- Easy to track cash vs card
- No confusion later

---

## 📝 RECOMMENDED CARD FORMAT

### When Moving to BILLS List:

**Card Title:** Keep as is  
**Card Description:** Add payment info at top

```
💰 PAYMENT RECEIVED
Amount: $350.00
Date: 12/12/2024
Method: Cash
Invoice: [if you created one]

[Rest of original description]
```

**Labels:** Create these
- 🟢 PAID - CASH
- 🔵 PAID - CHECK  
- 🟣 PAID - CREDIT CARD
- 🟡 PAID - VENMO/ZELLE

## ✅ SYSTEM GOING FORWARD

### Every Job From Now On:

1. **Job Complete** → Customer pays
2. **Immediately:** Move card to BILLS
3. **Add to card:** Amount, date, method
4. **Monthly:** Review BILLS list = Your revenue!

### Invoicing (if not paid immediately):
1. **Job Complete** → Stay in "Need to Bill"

3. **Payment Received** → Move to BILLS

### Never Again:
- Jobs in "Complete" without payment tracking
- Wondering "Did they pay me?"
- Lost revenue
